<h1>Writing A Blog</h1>
<p>June 24, 2016</p>
<p>This is my first blog post ever.  I've always thought
it would be cool to keep a blog.  There are so many
entrepreneurs out there who advocate keeping a blog
to generate passive income.  But there's one big problem.</p>

<p>All of these bloggers only write about one thing:
  how spectacular it is to generate passive income by creating a blog.
  That's right, all of these entrepreneurs make money off of blogging,
  <em> by writing about how to make money by blogging</em>.
  It's pretty meta and if you read too many of these blogs,
  you will quickly find yourself inside a dizzying echo chamber.</p>

<p>So now that I am finally writing a blog,
I suppose it's only right that my first post is indeed about
writing a blog. And you now what? It's pretty easy to make a blog.
The bad news is I'm not making money off of it.  Yet. It's all just for Turing for now.
But it's great to kick off Module 2 by doing something
I've been wanting to do for a long time.  Now I just need
to find some interesting things to share.</p>
