   So you've decided you want to learn how to Ruby.  Excellent.  Where to start?
   Let's walk through a few of the fundamental concepts of coding.
   First up, we have variables.
</p>
If I want to store a value in Ruby, I can simply assign it to a variable.
For instance, if I have the number 3, and I want to save it, all I have to do is assign it to a variable.
 <pre>
   x = 3
 </pre>
 <p>
   Now 3 is saved as x.  I can access 3 by typing x.  If I want to change this value, I can simply re-assign it.
 </p>
 <pre>
   x = 4
 </pre>
<p>
  x is now saved as 4, and I can access the number 4 simply by entering x.
</p>
<p>
  But what if I now have another number 2? What shall I do with it? I can assign 2 to another variable.
</p>
<pre>
  bananas = 2
</pre>
<p>
  Why is 2 saved as bananas?  Because I can assign variables to whatever I want.  Well, that's not entirely true.  There are some syntactical restrictions.  In general though, it's good practice to name variables based on what they represent.  So if I wanted to represent two bananas, this would be a perfect name.
  Now I can use my variables to perform calculations.
</p>
<pre>
  x * bananas
</pre>
<p>
  What do you expect this to yield? If you answered something to do with bananas, you might be hungry. Go get something to eat and come back.
 I'll still be here.
</p>
<p>
  Okay, now that you're well fed, this equation evalutes to 8.  I can use any normal mathematical operations on x and bananas.  It's just like algebra class again.
  I can also save this result as another variable.
</p>
<pre>
  total = x * bananas
</pre>
<p>
  Our variable named total now returns a value of 8.
</p>
<p>
  Another important programming concept is booleans.  A boolean is a data type that can be either true or false.
  I can also save booleans by assigning them to variables.
</p>
<pre>
  blogging = true
  sleeping = false
</pre>
<p>
  We can use booleans to create a flow of logic.  Creating a logical sequence of events allows computers to get things done.
  One way to create this flow is to use conditionals.
</p>
<pre>
  if blogging == false
     sleep = true
  elsif blogging == true
     sleeping = 7
  end
</pre>
<p>
  In the previous example, the double-equal sign represents a boolean.  Whereas a regular equals sign is used to to assign a value to a variable, a double-equal sign is used to check to see if the two values are equal.
  In other words, the double-equal actually returns a boolean, since it will evaluate to either true or false.
</p>
<p>
  Earlier above we set blogging equal to true:
</p>
<pre>
  blogging = true
</pre>
<p>
  In our conditional, we first check to see if blogging is equal to false
</p>
<pre>
  blogging == false
</pre>
<p>
  Since we set it to true above, this boolean evalutes to false, and we do not execute the code below the if statement.
  The assignment which would set sleep equal to true, does not execute because the statement following `if` is not true.
  So this code does not execute:
</p>
<pre>
  sleep = true
</pre>
<p>
  Instead, we skip to the next `if` condition, which is now denoted by an elsif block.
  Here we see another evaluation which checks to if blogging is equal to true.
</p>
<pre>
  blogging == true
</pre>
<p>
  We know from above that we set blogging equal to true, so this boolean evaluates to true.
  This means that code nested inside this elsif condition will execute.
  In this case, that means we now set the variable sleeping to 7.
</p>
<pre>
  sleeping = 7
</pre>
<p>
  We initially set sleeping to be true, so we have changed it's value.  This shows you again that variables can be assigned to anything.
    Even though we had a boolean earlier on, we overwrote that boolean by assigning the same variable to a number.
</p>
<p>
  So there you have a very shoddy and fast introduction to some basic coding concepts.  More to come soon.
