<h1>Mindfulness and Programming</h1>
<p>July 31, 2016</p>
<p>
Turing is hard.  Many students have described it as the hardest thing they’ve ever done.  One reason why it’s is so difficult is because problem solving and overcoming challenges are simply the nature of being a programmer.  While sometimes things seem to flow, other times it can feel like the computers are conspiring against us.  Since dealing with challenges is an inherent part of coding, learning how to self-regulate and take care of yourself is essential for your well-being.  Mindfulness can be an invaluable tool to help you do this.

Mindfulness is a practice of cultivating awareness.  To be mindful is to simply observe what is happening in the present moment without judgment or trying to change it.  In other words, it is a practice of learning to objectively notice your internal state.
</p>
<p>
Let’s say you’re working on a project and have been stuck on a particular assumption for over an hour.  You look at your code and think your logic all checks out.  But it’s still not working.  You are becoming more frustrated by the minute, and are starting to wonder if the best solution would be to toss your computer into a river.
</p>
<p>
Now is the time to take a step back and start to notice yourself.  Notice the thoughts running through your mind. Are you blaming yourself for not being good enough? Are you frustrated by how much time you’ve spent on one bug?  Notice the tension in your body.  Is your jaw clenched?  Are your shoulders tight?  Observe what is happening to you in the present moment without trying to change it.  In particular, noticing your breath is a great way to begin this process of self-observation.  The breath is an important link between mind and body since it occurs unconsciously yet can also be consciously regulated.  Through this process of simple self-observation, you give yourself an opportunity to process your internal state and allow it to pass.

While you don’t need any cutting-edge apps to practice mindfulness, it’s called a practice for a reason - it’s hard work.  It can be incredibly challenging to learn to step outside of ourselves.  We live in a world that is highly reactive, and mindfulness is a process of learning to consciously respond instead of unconsciously react.  Both Turing and the programming landscape are filled with uncertainty.  Besides learning how to code, one of the most valuable skills you can take away from a challenging experience like Turing is learning to become comfortable with that uncertainty.  As a student who is currently storming through the trenches of Turing, mindfulness allows me to find calm in that storm.  I hope it can do the same for you.  If you are interested in learning more, I recommend reading Radical Acceptance by Tara Brach, looking into the teachings of Jon Kabat-Zinn, and digging deeper into the practice of mindfulness meditation.
