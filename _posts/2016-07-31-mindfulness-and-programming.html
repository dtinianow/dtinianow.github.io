  Turing is hard.  Many students will tell you it’s the hardest thing they’ve ever done.  Turing will push you to learn more than you thought you were capable of, and just when you feel your brain cannot hold another ounce of information, it will somehow squeeze in more.  With such an immense challenge also comes an incredible learning opportunity.  I’m not just talking about learning how to code - we do plenty of that already.  I’m referring to a more subtle type of learning: self-regulation.  As a Turing student, learning to take care of yourself is just as important as learning to code.  Mindfulness can be an invaluable tool to help you do this.

As programmers, we know that problem solving is the nature of our work.  We constantly run into bugs and hit obstacles.   While sometimes things seem to flow, other times it can feel like the computers are all conspiring against us (they probably are).  It is times like these that mindfulness is your friend.

Mindfulness is a practice of cultivating awareness.  To be mindful is to simply observe what is happening in the present moment without judgment or trying to change it.  In other words, it is a practice of learning to objectively notice your internal state.

Let’s say you’re pair programming and have been stuck on a particular assumption for over an hour.  You look at your code and think your logic all checks out.  But it’s still not working.  Your partner is become increasingly frustrated and wants to call it a day. You’re starting to think the best solution would be to turn your computer into a fireworks display.

Now is the time to take a step back and start to notice yourself.  Notice the thoughts running through your mind. Are you blaming yourself for not being good enough? Are you frustrated by how much time you’ve spent on one bug?  Notice the tension in your body.  Is your jaw clenched?  Are your shoulders tight?  Observe what is happening to you in the present moment without trying to change it.  Notice yourself without judging yourself for those experiences.  Mindfulness is an opportunity to acknowledge and accept yourself.  Through this process, you give yourself an opportunity to allow your internal state to pass.  This can help you get back to work with a fresh set of eyes.

While you don’t need any cutting-edge apps to practice mindfulness, it’s called a practice for a reason - it is hard work.  It can be incredibly challenging to learn to step outside of yourself.  We live in a world that is highly reactive, and mindfulness is a process of learning to consciously respond instead of unconsciously react.  Both Turing and the programming landscape are filled with uncertainty.  Besides learning to code, one of the most valuable skills you can take away from Turing is learning to become comfortable with uncertainty.  As a student who is currently working through the trenches of Turing, mindfulness helps me find calm in the storm.  I hope it can do the same for you.  If you are interested in learning more, I recommend reading Radical Acceptance by Tara Brach, looking into the teachings of Jon Kabat-Zinn, and digging deeper into the practice of mindfulness meditation.
